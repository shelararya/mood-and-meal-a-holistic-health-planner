      <h3>👩‍💼 Our Story</h3>
      <p>
        Mood and Meal was born out of a simple yet powerful idea: to help people feel better through small, meaningful choices. Our founder, a certified holistic health coach, struggled with emotional eating and stress-induced fatigue for years. After discovering the power of mindful eating and emotional self-awareness, she created Mood and Meal to help others on the same journey.
